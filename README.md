- Clicking an app name brings it into focus (behind the sidebar).
- Built with Python using `tkinter` and `pywin32`.

## 💡 Why This Project?

I often work on research, writing, or competitions where I juggle multiple apps — browsers, document editors, image viewers, etc. This tool serves as a lightweight "heads-up display" of all active apps, helping me stay focused and organized.
